In all services, create method, under validateCreate, modify the section for <controller-name>TypeId to:
// error should only be invoked if 'coopTypeId' was also a requred field.
        else if(this.cRules.required.includes('coopTypeId')) {

        instead of just else{}

Otherwise controllers that do not have TypeId like coopRef may errously fail.
